### This repository contains a project that I completed as part of my Ph.D. in Economics coursework at [PIMES/UFPE](https://sites.google.com/view/pimes/principal) in Recife, Brazil. The project was submitted at the end of July 2021 and is quite lengthy. Therefore, on April 5th, 2023, I have decided to break it down into smaller parts. The original final project is named "covid19project_andreluizcoelho.ipynb".

## 1. Webscraping 
### The Covid-19 data is initially webscraped with information such as Total Cases and Death Cases from [World Meters](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). 


## 2. Covid-19 Vaccines
### Vaccine data is acquired using url from a [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv) page.

## 3. Coutries Indicators 
### 3.1 Human Development Index
### The [downloaded](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI) newest HDI is from 2021. On the "covid19project_andreluizcoelho.ipynb" the newest was from 2019. So, some details in the code had to change.
### The [ISO](https://www.iso.org/standards.html) from each country is generated in this section
