### This repository contains a project that I completed as part of my Ph.D. in Economics coursework at [PIMES/UFPE](https://sites.google.com/view/pimes/principal) in Recife, Brazil. The project was submitted at the end of July 2021 and is quite lengthy. Therefore, on April 5th, 2023, I have decided to break it down into smaller parts. [This](https://github.com/andreluizcoelho/Covid-19-Project/blob/main/covid19project_andreluizcoelho.ipynb) is the first original final project. The project is a descriptive analysis which uses Covid data and many Economic data. It begins with webscraping and it ends with machine learning application, besides including many data visualizations after several merges between the data.  

## 1. Webscraping 
#### The Covid-19 data is initially webscraped with information such as Total Cases and Death Cases from [World Meters](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). 


## 2. Covid-19 Vaccines
#### Vaccine data is acquired using url from a [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv) page.

## 3. Countries Indicators 
### 3.1 Human Development Index
#### The [downloaded](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI) newest HDI is from 2021. On the [first](https://github.com/andreluizcoelho/Covid-19-Project/blob/main/covid19project_andreluizcoelho.ipynb) original final project the newest HDI was from 2019. So, some details in the code had to change.
#### The [ISO](https://www.iso.org/standards.html) from each country is generated in this section
### 3.2 World Bank Data
#### 3.2.1 Growth Domestic Product (GDP) per capita
#### The GDP per capita data can be downloaded [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD), and for direct [download](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?downloadformat=excel)
#### GDP per capita is also for 2021, where in the original final project it was from 2019. 
#### 3.2.2 Growth Domestic Product (GDP) 
#### The GPD data can be downloaded [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD), and for direct [download](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?downloadformat=excel)
#### GDP is also for 2021, where in the original final project it was from 2019 
#### 3.2.3 Unemployment Rate 
#### The Unemployment Rate data can be downloaded [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS), and for direct [download](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SL.UEM.TOTL.ZS?downloadformat=excel)
#### The Unemployment data is for 2021, where in the original final project it was from 2020.
#### 3.2.4 Inflation Rate 
#### The Inflation Rate data can be downloaded [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG), and for direct [download](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?downloadformat=excel)
#### The Inflation data is for 2021, where in the original final project it was from 2019.
#### 3.2.5 GDP Growth (Annual %) 
#### The GDP growth data can be downloaded [here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG), for direct [download](https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG?downloadformat=excel)
#### The GDP Growth data is for 2021, where in the original final project it was from 2019.
## 4. Merging the datas
#### Merging World Indicators Data (World Bank (GDP, GDP per capita, GDP growth, unemployment rate, inflation rate) & United Nations (HDI)) with Covid Vaccines and then with Covid Cases/Deaths
### 4.1 Merging World Bank Data (GDP, GDP per capita, GDP growth, unemployment rate, inflation rate)
#### 4.1.1 Merging GDP with GDP per capita
#### 4.1.2 Merging GDP growth with gdppercapitagdp (the merge between GDP with GDP per capita)
#### 4.1.3 Merging between Unemployment rate and Inflation Rate
#### 4.1.4 Merging between GDPs (gdp, gdp per capita and gdp growth) with unemploymentinflationrate (unemployment rate and inflation rate)
### 4.2 Merging World Bank Data (GDP, GDP per capita, GDP growth, unemployment rate, inflation rate) & United Nations (HDI)
### 4.3 Merging Economic Indicator (World Bank Data with United Nations (HDI)) with Covid Vaccines
### 4.4 Merging the (Economic Indicators and Covid Vaccines) with Covid Cases/Deaths
## 5. Data Visualization
### OBS: Unfortunately, the graphs from Plotly are not rendered on the GitHub page when the ipynb file is opened. While many of these graphs are interactive, only a static image with the 'fig.show('svg')' code is displayed, although some maps still will not show up, and some will show up less nicely and not interactive. Without this code, nothing will appear when opening the ipynb file. To experience the full interactivity of the Plotly graphs, please run the code on your own machine without the 'fig.show('svg')' code. That's why there are two versions uploaded for Part 5 - '5. Data Visualization' which is interactive and '5. Data Visualization Static' which can be displayed on the GitHub page.
### 5.1 Mapping
#### 5.1.1 Globe
#### 5.1.2 World Map
### 5.2 Graphs
#### 5.2.1 Scatter Plots
#### 5.2.2 Bar Graphs

### 5.3 Maps with Shapefiles
#### obs: There are two very common ways to work with map plotting:
#### 1.From latitude and longitude finding a point to plot over the shapefile OR 2.Merging the shapefile with the data, not plotting the point over it
#### 5.3.1 From latitude and longitude finding a point to plot over the shapefile
#### 5.3.2 Merging the shapefile with the data, not plotting the point over it
### 5.4 More Maps, Bubble Chart and Boxplot with Plotly
