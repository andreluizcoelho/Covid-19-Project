### This repository contains a project that I completed as part of my Ph.D. in Economics coursework at PIMES/UFPE in Recife, Brazil. The project was submitted at the end of July 2021 and is quite lengthy. Therefore, on April 5th, 2023, I have decided to break it down into smaller parts. The original final project is named "covid19project_andreluizcoelho.ipynb".

###The Covid-19 data is initially webscraped, cleaned, and analyzed using graphs and charts.
